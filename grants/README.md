Grant applications, administrative documents, and institutional work.

## Organization

```
grants/
├── active/
│   ├── grant-name-1/
│   │   ├── README.md        # Grant details, deadlines
│   │   ├── proposal.md      # Draft proposal
│   │   └── budget.xlsx
│   └── grant-name-2/
├── submitted/
├── templates/               # Reusable boilerplate
└── admin/                   # Other institutional docs
```

## Usage

- Track grant deadlines in README.md for each grant
- Keep templates for common sections (bio, facilities, etc.)
- Archive submitted grants for reference

*Grants have hard deadlines — consider adding them to your TODO.md or calendar.*

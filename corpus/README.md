# Corpus

Research by others — papers, readings, and reference material.

## Organization

Organize by topic, project, or however makes sense for your workflow:

```
corpus/
├── topic-1/
│   ├── paper-1.pdf
│   └── paper-2.pdf
├── topic-2/
└── to-read/
```

## Usage

- Add PDFs and papers relevant to your research
- Agents can read these for context when working on related projects
- Consider adding a `notes.md` for each major paper with key takeaways

*This folder is for reference material. Your own writing goes in `publications/` or `research-essays/`.*
